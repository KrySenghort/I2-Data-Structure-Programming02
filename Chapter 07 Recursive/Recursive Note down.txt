-   Recursive function is a function that called itself repeatitively until condition is satisfied.
-   There are two types of functions such as :
        +   standard library function
            Ex: <stdio.h>  provide functions : scanf() , printf()
        +   user defined function 
            Ex: <math.h>   provide functions : pow(), sqrt(), ceil(), floor(), cos(), sin(),.......
There are two types of recursive functions :
-   Direct recursion : is the function that calls itself just like we saw in the above program.
-   Indirect recursion : is the function that calls another function and then that function calls the calling function.

+   Advantages of Recursive function :
-   Less number code lines are used in the recursion program and hence the code looks shorter and cleaner.
-   Recursion is easy to approach to solve the problems involving data structure and algorithms like graph and tree
-   Recursion helps to reduce the time complexity 
-   It helps to reduce unnecessary calling of the function
-   It helps to solve the stack evolutions and prefix, infix, postfix evaluation
-   Recursion is the best method to define objects that have repeated structural forms
+   Disadvantages of C++ Recursion
-   It consumes a lot of stack space
-   It takes more time to process the program
-   If an error is accrued in the program, it is difficult to debug the error in comparison to the iterative program.
